= Spring-Boot Camel QuickStart

This quickstart demonstrates how to connect a Spring-Boot application to a JBoss Data Grid (or Infinispan) server using the Hot Rod protocol.
It requires that the data grid server (or cluster) has been deployed first.

In the example, a Camel route is using the Infinispan server as idempotent repository, filtering out messages that have already been processed.
Messages having a bounded random ID are created through a configurable generator.
Another Camel route shows how to lookup cache entries in the Infinispan server.

Both routes use the `default` cache of the data grid, although this can be changed in the `application.properties` file.
The default name for the target data grid cluster is `DATAGRID_APP_HOTROD`. It can be changed from the spring-boot configuration file or
using the environment variable `DATAGRID_SERVICE_NAME`.

The application utilizes the Spring http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ImportResource.html[`@ImportResource`] annotation to load a Camel Context definition via a _src/main/resources/spring/camel-context.xml_ file on the classpath.
